# React + Vite

# Working with react query

- makes fetching and managing data in the application a whole lot easier

- it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your web applications a breeze.

- TanStack Query (FKA React Query) is often described as the missing data-fetching library for web applications
- - https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/migrating-to-v5#supports-a-single-signature-one-object

- using 'initialData', static data given to use from nextjs, can be fed into put query
- - allows us to start with static data but still have a dynamic page for fetching new data and adding new data
